                <h2 class="about-title">About me</h2>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>I like saying that I'm pretty lucky as feel like I've lived three lives instead of one, but this one is my favourite. I was an engineer of optoelectronic and laser devices and systems in my first life, and then I became a lawyer and worked in this field for more than ten years. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My relocation to London helped me to really develop my English skills, and also gave me the opportunity to try myself in coding. I began learning Web Development in January 2021 and quickly realised that this was precisely what I have tried to find my whole life. I love learning new things, am open-minded to new technologies and tools, and want to create beautiful and functional websites.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I don't like to wish for something, but I always have a detailed plan for self-development. Currently, I'm working on my projects, deepening my knowledge of Web Development and discovering modern tools and features. At the same time, as a real team player and a person who likes communicating, learning and sharing knowledge and experience with others, I'm ready to try myself at more significant projects.</p>
                    <p>I have been committed to learning throughout my whole life. So, my slogan is "I can't go a single day without picking up something new." My organisational skills also assist me in facilitating learning fast and constantly developing my abilities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I like to dive deep into the subject I study and use my imagination to visualise and understand the whole process before putting what I've learned into practice.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although I am a self-taught person and over time have developed ways to solve many problems independently, I am always open to feedback and constructive criticism, and I am happy to discuss and solve problems with my mentors, management and teammates.</p>
